### Rotary Club Dashboard for their Annual Budget
*current values have been blacked out and future values are randomized*
<p>
In sharing this project, I want to showcase some of my experience in not only visualizing data, but also handling real data through the general cleanup process, restructuring the data to be able to use for pivot tables, and taking feedback from the end-user (in lieu of cient here since this was an unpaid project) to give them a dynamic dashboard that would accomodate all future values.

Some highlights of this project was:
1. Using the RANDBETWEEN(#,#) function to ensure that I had future values to build my dashboard around.
2. Incorporating conditional formatting in the Difference column of the budget sheet that was given to me, so the Rotary Club could more easily see patterns in their data.
3. Using VLOOKUP to restructure the data in a new worksheet. This new worksheet served as the source for my dashboard's pivotcharts.
4. Using Excel's Visual Basic Application (VBA), I added a Macro to my dashboard to ensure that the Rotary Cliub would be able to refresh the data across all visualzations and tables with the click of a button, instead of click the Refresh All button in the Data tab.
5. I wanted their to be a scroll bar for the table at the bottom of my dashboard, only revealing the 10 lines at a time. Since their are only 10 events that were listed as income sources for the year, this choice made sense and is why only the table under the "Quarterly Expenses Expected vs. Actual Values" section has a scroll bar.
6. Color was important to me, so I not only wanted the theme to match this Rotary Club's colors (blue and orange), but also match sure that my choice of color in the visualization titles facilitated their interpretation and was not just adding color for the sake of being colorful.
